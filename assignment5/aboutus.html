	<h1><u>About us</u></h1>
	<p>Xiaomi was founded in 2010 by serial entrepreneur Lei Jun, who believes that high-quality
technology doesn't need to cost a fortune. We create remarkable hardware, software, and internet
services for and with the help of our Mi fans. We incorporate their feedback into our product range,
which currently includes the Mi Note Pro, Mi Note, Mi 4, Redmi 2, Mi TV, Mi Band and other accesso-
ries. With more than 61 million handsets sold in 2014, and products launched in Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, India, Indonesia and Brazil, Xiaomi is
expanding its footprint across the world to become a global brand.</p>
<H1><u>Our culture</u></h1>
<br>
<P>"Just for fans" â€“ that's our belief. Our hardcore Mi fans lead every step of the way. In fact, many
Xiaomi employees were first Mi fans before joining the team. As a team, we share the same relentless
pursuit of perfection, constantly refining and enhancing our products to create the best user experience
possible. We are also fearless in testing new ideas and pushing our own boundaries. Our dedication
and belief in innovation, together with the support of Mi fans, are the driving forces behind our
unique Mi products. </P>
